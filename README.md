# eFarmony Project

This document will guide you through the entire process for the project, with plenty of extra work for you to do at home for practice.

## Goals
Today we will practice our JavaScript Fundamentals by creating eFarmony, a dating app that enables animals to find the love they deserve! We will create the data structures and logic that will power your application. After the exercises you are welcome to create the user interface using HTML/CSS and a little jQuery (or JavaScript DOM for the purists)!

## Getting Started
Download the zip file of this repository. Explore the files.

Run the __index.html__ file in your browser. It will appear blank, but will make all your JavaScript files available in your JavaScript console.

You will be using console.log() a lot to check your work. When you complete a section, feel free to comment out any console.log() statements so that you don't clutter up your console as you are testing your code.

The __scripts.js__ file is where you will be writing all of your code.

##FAQ

### What will I need to do well in the class?
- You should have some exposure to JavaScript syntax fundamentals, such as loops and control flow, objects and arrays. __If you are relatively new to these concepts, please feel free to ask for help during the exercises.__
- While you are welcome to use any browser you like, Chrome has some of the best dev tools available, and it's highly recommended that you try it for this project.
- Any plain text editor will suffice for you to edit the exercise files. [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) is my personal favorite.

### What if I finish an exercise with extra time?
If you finish one of the assignments ahead of schedule, your best bet is to research and reinforce any previous concepts you feel shaky on, since each lecture is designed to build on a firm understanding of the previous ones.
